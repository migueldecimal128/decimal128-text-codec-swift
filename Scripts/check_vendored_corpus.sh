# Drift check for the vendored conformance corpus.
#
# Tests/Decimal128TextCodecTests/vectors holds four CSVs vendored from
# decimal128-text-codec-c/tests/vectors, which is this family's corpus of
# record. That repo is private, so this compares against decimal128-resources
# instead -- the public repo where the decimal128-c engine generated them, and
# which the C copy tracks exactly. Checking the grandparent rather than the
# parent costs nothing here and is the only version CI can actually reach
# without credentials.
#
# This is a plain exact comparison: every data row must match, in order. It used
# to exempt "NaN(1)" and "NaN(123)", which upstream rejected and the codecs
# accepted; the full ports took the parenthesised payload in 2026-08-23 and
# upstream moved both rows to the parse table, so there is nothing left to
# exempt.
#
#   usage: check_vendored_corpus.sh <resources/string_bid_dpd> <vectors dir>
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on drift, 2 on a usage or path error.
