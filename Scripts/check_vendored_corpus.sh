# Drift check for the vendored conformance corpus.
#
# Tests/Decimal128TextCodecTests/vectors holds four CSVs vendored from
# decimal128-text-codec-c/tests/vectors, which is this family's corpus of
# record. That repo is private, so this compares against decimal128-resources
# instead -- the public repo where the decimal128-c engine generated them, and
# which the C copy tracks exactly except for the two rows below. Checking the
# grandparent rather than the parent costs nothing here and is the only version
# CI can actually reach without credentials.
#
# The error table is EXPECTED to differ, by exactly two rows and no others.
# "NaN(1)" and "NaN(123)" assert a NaN-payload rejection the codecs no longer
# perform, and upstream is deliberately left alone because it is generated and
# the engine is right to reject them. Anything beyond those two rows is real
# drift and fails here.
#
#   usage: check_vendored_corpus.sh <resources/string_bid_dpd> <vectors dir>
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on drift, 2 on a usage or path error.
